# S.22 Modern Async with Redux Toolkit Query

## Introducing Redux Toolkit Query

Hooks that automate the request-making process

-   useFetchAlbumsQuery
-   useAddAlbumMutation
-   useRemoveAlbumMutation

⇒ Query: means that we are making a request specifically to read or fetch some data

⇒ Mutation: means we are making a request to change or write some data.

### Redux Toolkit Query

-   Handles tons of corner cases, Almost all aspects of making requests
-   FIne-grained loading state
-   FIne-grained error state
-   Data caching and refetching

## Creating a RTK Query API

1. Identify a group of related requests that your app needs to make
2. Make a new file that will create the api
3. The API needs to store an ton of state related to data, request status, errors. Add a ‘reducerPath’
4. The API needs to know how and where to send requests. Add a ‘baseQuery’
5. Add ‘endpoints’, one for each kind of request you want to make. Reqs that read data are queries, write data are mutations
6. Export all of the automatically generated hooks
7. Connect the API to the store. Reducer, middleware, and listeners
8. Export the hooks from the store/index.js file
9. Use the generated hooks in a component

```jsx
**import { createApi } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react';

const albumsApi = createApi({
    reducerPath: 'albums',
});**
```
