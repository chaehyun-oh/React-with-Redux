# S.20 Manazing Multiple Slices with Redux Toolkit

## Project Overview

: We’re going to make an application that’s going to allow a user to track to couple of cars or vehicles that they own.

-   List of cars should be searchable
-   If ‘car name’ partially matches an existing car, bold the existing car

## Thinking About Derived State

### Redux Store Design

1. Identify what state exists in the app
2. Identify how that state changes over time
3. Group together common pieces of state
4. Create a slice for each group

### What State Do We Need?

-   name - string
-   cost - number
-   search Term - string
-   cars - Array of { id, name, cost }
-   totalCost - number ⇒ Derived State
-   matchedCars ⇒ Derived State

**Derived State** : Values that we can calculate using existing state

## Thinking About Redux Design

### How is that state changing over time?

-   changeName
-   changeCost
-   changeSearchTerm
-   addCar
-   removeCar

## Adding the Form Slice

```
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const formSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'form',
    initialState: {
        name: '',
        cost: 0,
    },
    reducers: {
        changeName(state, action) {
            state.name = action.payload;
        },
        changeCost(state, action) {
            state.cost = action.payload;
        },
    }
});

export const { changeName, changeCost } = formSlice.actions;
export const formReducer = formSlice.reducer;
```

## Maintaining a Collection with a Slice

```jsx
import { createSlice, nanoid } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const carsSlice = createSlice({
	name: "cars",
	initialState: {
		searchTerm: "",
		cars: [],
	},
	reducers: {
		changeSearchTerm(state, action) {
			state.searchTerm = action.payload;
		},
		addCar(state, action) {
			state.cars.push({
				name: action.payload.name,
				cost: action.payload.cost,
				id: nanoid(),
			});
		},
		removeCar(state, action) {
			const updated = state.cars.filter((car) => {
				return car.id !== action.payload;
			});
			state.cars = updated;
		},
	},
});

export const { changeSearchTerm, addCar, removeCar } = carsSlice.actions;
export const carsReducer = carsSlice.reducer;
```
