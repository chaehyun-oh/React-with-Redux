# S.11 Mastering the State Design Process

## Project Organization

: In the world of React Components, we usually refer to a component using one of two terms. So a React component is either a component or a page.

-   Comonent : Reusable React Component that shows a handful of elements
-   Page : Still a React component. Not intended to be reused.

### File/Folder Organization

-   On any large project, youâ€™ll end up using search to find files, rather than manual navigation
-   Having a bunch of files in a folder is not inherently bad

## Reminder on Building Lists

```jsx
// App.js

import Accordion from "./components/Accordion";

function App() {
	const items = [
		{
			id: "whewe",
			label: "Can I use React on a project?",
			content: "You can use React on any project you want.",
		},
		{
			id: "whewawegea",
			label: "Can I use React on a project?",
			content: "You can use JS on any project you want.",
		},
		{
			id: "whewawe1e",
			label: "Can I use React on a project?",
			content: "You can use Vue.js on any project you want.",
		},
	];

	return <Accordion items={items} />;
}
export default App;
```

```jsx
// Accordion.js

function Accordion({ items }) {
	const renderedItems = items.map((item) => {
		return (
			<div key={item.id}>
				<div>{item.label}</div>
				<div>{item.content}</div>
			</div>
		);
	});
	return <div>{renderedItems}</div>;
}

export default Accordion;
```
