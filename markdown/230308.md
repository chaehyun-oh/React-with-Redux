# S.19 Dive into Redux Toolkit

## Connecting React to Redux

(once per project)

1. Export the ‘store’ from whatever file it is created in
2. Import the store into the root ‘index.js’ file
3. Import ‘Provider’ from the ‘react-redux’ library
4. Wrap the App component with the Provider, pass the store to the Provider

## Updating State from a Component

### Changing State

1. Add a reducer to one of your slices that changes state in some particular way
2. Export the action creator that the slice automatically creates
3. Find the component that you want to dispatch from
4. Import the action creator function and ‘useDispatch’ from react-redux
5. Call the ‘useDispatch’ hook to get access to the dispatch function
6. When the user does something, call the action creator to get an action, then dispatch it

```jsx
// SongPlaylist.js

function SongPlaylist() {
	const dispatch = useDispatch();
	const songPlaylist = [];

	const handleSongAdd = (song) => {
		const action = addSong(song);
		dispatch(action);
	};

	const hanadleRemove = (song) => {};
}
```
