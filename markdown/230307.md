# S.19 Dive into Redux Toolkit

## Understanding Slices

Slices are what save us from having to write out all this boilerplate (Reducer → Switch → case A → code to run in case statement).

```jsx
const songsSlice = createSlice({
	name: "song",
	initialState: [],
	reducers: {
		addSong(state, action) {
			// state is not the big state object in the store
			// It is the piece of state managed by this reducer
			state.push(action.payload);
		},
		removeSong(state, action) {},
	},
});
```

## Understanding Action Creators

Action Creators : Set of functions created for us automatically. When called, they return an action that we can dispatch. Save us from having to manually write out action objects.

```jsx

store.dispatch({
	songsSlice.actions.addSong('Some song!')
);
```
