# S.18 Into the World of Reducers

## Refactoring to a Switch

```jsx
const reducer = (state, action) => {
	switch (action.type) {
		case INCREMENT_COUNT:
			return {
				...state,
				count: state.count + 1,
			};
		case SET_VALUE_TO_ADD:
			return {
				...state,
				valueToAdd: action.payload,
			};
		default:
			// throw new Error('unexpected action type: ' + action.type);
			//  or
			return state;
	}
};
```

## Adding New State Updates

```jsx
case ADD_VALUE_TO_COUNT:
                return {
                    ...state,
                    count: state.count + state.valueToAdd,
                    valueToAdd: 0,
                };
```

## A Few Design Considerations Around Reducers

-   Usually makes more sense ot stuff logic into the reducer and keep the dispatches simple
-   Less duplicated code if you need to dispatch the same action in multiple places
-   Part of the goal of reducers is to have a very specific set of ways that state can be changed

## Introducing Immer

immer : Library that lets you write code to directly mutate state.

Reducer with Immer : You can mutate state, Do not have to return a new value, Still return in each case, otherwise you get ‘fallthrough’

```jsx
const reducer = (state, action) => {
	switch (action.type) {
		case INCREMENT_COUNT:
			state.count = state.count + 1;
			return;
		default:
			return;
	}
};
```
