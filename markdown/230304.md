# S.19 Dive into Redux Toolkit

## Into the World of Redux

What is Redux? ⇒ Redux is a library for managing state using the same techniques as useReducer.

React-Redux : Library to help communicate between the React and Redux sides of your project

## Redux vs Redux Toolkit

### `action ⇒ Dispatch Function` Why is this pattern so popular?

-   If we want to change state in any way, we must call `dispatch`
-   Really good thing : Central point of changing state. Easy to understand why state is changing
-   Not so great thing : We have to write out a lot of boilerplate code just to make sure the reducer knows what to do

### Use Redux Toolkit (RTK)

-   RTK is a wrapper around plain Redux
-   Specifically simplifies the action type creation process
-   This is the recommended way moving foward
