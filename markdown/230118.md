# S.4 State: How to Change Your App

## Introducing the State System

Update content on screen → State System

-   Need some kind of ‘count’ variable
-   Should start with a value of 0
-   Add 1 whenever the user clicks
-   Whenever the value is changed, update content on screen (rerender)

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	const handleClick = () => {
		setCount(count + 1);
	};

	return (
		<div>
			<button onClick={handleClick}>Add Animal</button>
			<div>Number of animals : {count}</div>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

## More on State

State : Data that changes as the user interacts with our app. When this data changes, React will update content on the screen automatically.

⇒ This is the one-and-only way we can change what content React show. (Even other libs that appear to update content use the state system behind the scenes.)

`const [count, setCount] = useState(0)` : Define a piece of state with the useState function. Array destructuring. Fancy way to get access to the piece of state + setter. `[ piece of state, Setter function ]`

And give a value to the useState function. This is the default, starting value for our piece of state.

`Number of animals : {count}` : Use the state in some way in our component (often in the returned JSX)

`setCount(count + 1)` : When user does something, update the piece of state. Causes React to rerender the component.
