## Understanding Action Objects

`dispatch()`

-   When we call `dispatch`, we need to pass along some info to tell the reducer how the state should be updated
-   Billion ways to do this!
-   The React community has come up with a convention on how to tell the reducer what it needs to do
-   When we need to modify state, we will call `dispatch` and always pass in an `action` object
-   The `action` object will always have a `type` property that is a string. This helps tell the reducer waht state update it needs to make
-   If we need to communicate some data to the reducer, it will be placed on the `payload` property of the `action` object
-   This is very common community convention, not a requirement. React doesn’t treat these action object any differently.

```jsx
const reducer = (state, action) => {
	// Whatever gets returned will be the new state

	if (action.type === "increment") {
		return {
			...state,
			count: state.count + 1,
		};
	}

	if (action.type === "change-value-to-add") {
		return {
			...state,
			valueToAdd: action.payload,
		};
	}

	return state;
};

/////

const increment = () => {
	dispatch({
		type: "increment-count",
	});
};

/////

const handleChange = (e) => {
	const value = parseInt(e.target.value) || 0;
	dispatch({
		type: "change-value",
		payload: value,
	});
};
```

## Constant Action Types

-   Same thing as writing the string out directly, just prevents typos
-   If you make a typo in the variable name, an error will be thrown
-   The ‘ALL_CAPS’ is another community convention. Tell other engineers that this is an action type
