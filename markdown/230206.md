# S.10 Custom Navigation and Routing System

## Project Overview

### Goals

-   Tons and tons of practice with state, events, etc
-   Build components that just about every project will need
-   Navigation
-   Different approach to styling
-   Build a larger app that doesn’t require a lot of info sharing across components

## Some Button Theory

| Button Purpose                                        | Short Name |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Draw user’s attention to a good action                | Primary    |
| Draw user’s attention to a kind of good action        | Secondary  |
| Tell the user something good just hppend              | Success    |
| Warn the user about something                         | Warning    |
| Tell the user they’re about to do something dangerous | Danger     |

## The Children Prop

: If you ever create a cutom component, and then place anything inside of that pair of tags. So anything in between the two button elements or the two button tags that text right there is going to be taken automatically and provided as prop with a very special name down to your child Cumtom components.

```jsx
// App.js

import Button from "./Button";

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<div>
				<Button>click me</Button>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
export default App;
```

```jsx
// Button.js

function Button({ children }) {
	return <button>{children}</button>;
}

export default Button;
```

## Validating Props with PropTypes

### prop-types

-   JS library to validate the props that get passed into your component
-   If someone pasees down the incorrect kind of value (number instead of boolean), a warning will appear in console
-   Used to be very popular. Not Typescript does almost the same thing (and more)

[prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)

## PropTypes in Action

`!!undefined === false`

```jsx
// Button.js

import PropTypes from "prop-types";

function Button({
	children,
	primary,
	secondary,
	success,
	warning,
	danger,
	outline,
	rounded,
}) {
	return <button>{children}</button>;
}

Button.propTypes = {
	checkVariationValue: ({ primary, secondary, success, warning, danger }) => {
		const count =
			Number(!!primary) +
			Number(!!secondary) +
			Number(!!success) +
			Number(!!warning) +
			Number(!!danger);

		if (count > 1) {
			return new Error(
				"Invalid props : Only one of primary, secondary, success, warning, danger can be true"
			);
		}
	},
};

export default Button;
```
