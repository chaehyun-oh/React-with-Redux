# S.22 Modern Async with Redux Toolkit Query

## Options for Refetching Data

### Options for Handling Updated Data

1. Take the newly-created album from the response and add it into our list of albums
    1. Only one request
    2. All code becomes more complicated
    3. Response might not contain the needed data
2. After creating a new album, make a second request to get all albums
    1. Easier to picture data flow in the app
    2. Two request

## Request De-Duplication

-   Automatic data fetching is implemented using the “tag” system
-   Tags are a lot easier if you first understand how RTKQ tracks requests
-   Quick aside on RTKQ internals
