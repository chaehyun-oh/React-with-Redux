# S.19 Dive into Redux Toolkit

## Accessing State in a Component

1. Find the component that needs to access some state
2. Import the ‘useSelector’ hook from ‘react-redux’
3. Call the hook, passing in a selector function
4. Use the state. Anytime state changes, the component will automatically rerender

```jsx
// SongPlaylist.js

function SongPlaylist(){
	const dispatch = useDispatch();
	const songPlaylist = useSelector((state) => {
		return state.songs;
});
```

## Removing Content

```jsx
// index.js

const songsSlice = createSlice({
	name: "song",
	initialState: [],
	reducers: {
		addSong(state, action) {
			// state is not the big state object in the store
			// It is the piece of state managed by this reducer
			state.push(action.payload);
		},
		removeSong(state, action) {
			// action.payload === string, the song we want to remove
			const index = state.indexOf(action.payload);
			state.splice(index, 1);
		},
	},
});
```

```jsx
// SongPlaylist.js

function SongPlaylist(){
	const dispatch = useDispatch();
	const songPlaylist = useSelector((state) => {
		return state.songs;

	const handleSongAdd = (song) => {
		const action = addSong(song);
		dispatch(action);
	};

	const hanadleRemove = (song) => {
		dispatch(removeSong(song));
	}
};
```
