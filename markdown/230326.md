# S.21 Interfacing with API’s Using Async Thunks

## Local Fine-Grained Loading State

-   This might be a useful technique in some corner cases
-   Tedious to implement, so we will create a custom hook. More hook practice
-   Useful example to better understand async thunks
-   You might have to work on a project that uses Option #1

### dispatch(fetchUsers())

-   Returns a promise
-   The promise’s `.then()` gets called whether the request succeeds or fails
-   Argument to the `.then()` is the fulfilled or rejected action object

`.unwrap()` is going to give us a brand new promise back, and the promise we get back is going to follow the conventional rules. So the promise against return from unwrap, if we chain on a `.then()` this is going to be called only if the request succeeds. And if we chain on a `.catch()` , this is going to be called only if the request fails, and we can test that out really easily.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
	setIsLoadingUsers(true);
	dispatch(fetchUsers())
		.unwrap()
		.then(() => {
			console.log("success");
		})
		.catch(() => {
			console.log("fail");
		});
}, [dispatch]);
```
