# S.5 Using an API with React

## Overview of HTTP Requests

HTTP Request

-   Request Line : contain the URL that we want to make a request to.
    -   Method : Indicates the general goal of the request.
-   Header : We can add on a bunch of different headers that are going to customize the request in some way or provide some additional information over to the server thatâ€™s going to receive the request.
-   Body

HTTP Response

-   Status LIne
    -   Status : Indicates whether or not the request was successful.
-   Header
-   Body : In many cases, the body is going to contain the information that we were looking for when we originally made the request.

## Making an HTTP Request

: React itself has no functions/tools for making HTTP requests, To make requests, we commonly use either Axios or Fetch.

```jsx
// api.js

import axios from "axios";

const searchImages = async () => {
	const response = await axios.get("https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos", {
		headers: {
			Authorization: "Client-ID AccessKey",
		},
		params: {
			query: "cars",
		},
	});
	console.log(response);
	return response;
};

export default searchImages;
```
