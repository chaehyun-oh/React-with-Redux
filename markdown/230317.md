# S.21 Interfacing with API’s Using Async Thunks

## App Overview

When user first comes to tha app, we’re goning to make a network request to an outside API and fetch a list of users and show them on the screen.

### Few Things…

-   We are going to assume the user is on a bandwidth constrained connection
-   The data-loading experience must be near-perfect
-   We are going to first look at data fetching with plain RTK, then use RTK Query

## Adding a Few Dependencies

-   `@faker-js/faker` : to randomly generate some data we will get a Redux JS/toolkit
-   `json-server` : we’ll use for creating that API server, running it, receiving requests, saving data and so on

## API Server Setup

```json
// db.json
{
	"users": [],
	"albums": [],
	"photos": []
}
```

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
// ...
    "start:server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 3005",
// ...
  },
```
