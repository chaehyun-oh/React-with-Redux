# S.7 Data Persistence with API Requests

## Creating a New Record

```jsx
// App.js

const createBook = async (title) => {
	const response = await axios.post("http://localhost:3001/books", {
		title,
	});

	const updatedBooks = [...books, response.data];
	setBooks(updatedBooks);
};
```

## Fetching a List of Records

```jsx
const fetchBooks = async () => {
	const response = await axios.get("http://localhost:3001/books");

	setBooks(response.data);
};
```

## Introducing useEffect

### useEffect

-   Function that we import from React
-   Used to run code when a component is initially rendered and (sometimes) when it is rerendered

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("Hi");
}, []);
```

-   First argument is a fucntion that contains code we want to run
-   Second is an array or nothing - this controls whether function is executed on rerenders

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
	fetchBooks();
}, []);
```

## useEffect in Action

### Tricky Things Around useEffect

-   Understanding when our arrow function gets called
-   Understanding the arrow functionâ€™s return value
-   Underatanding stale variable references

### useEffect - Second argument

-   `[]` : Called after first render, Never called again
-   `empty` : Called after first render, Also called after every rerender
-   `[variale]` : Called after first render, Also called after rerenders if variable changed

## Updating a Record

```jsx
// App.js

const editBookById = async (id, newTitle) => {
        const response = await axios.put(`http://localhost:3001/books/${id}`, {
            title: newTitle
        });
```

## Thinking About Updates

```jsx
const updatedBooks = books.map((book) => {
      if (book.id === id) {
        return { ...book, ...response.data };
      }
```

## Deleting a Record

```jsx
const deleteBookById = async (id) => {
        await axios.delete(`http://localhost:3001/books/${id}`);
```
