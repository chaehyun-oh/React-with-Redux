## Multiple State Updates

### Ideas to Reset Both Lists

1. Have the movieSlice’s ‘reset’ function update the list of songs ⇒ WONT WORK
2. Dispatch two separate actions ⇒ TOTALLY FEASIBLE BUT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS
3. Get the songsSlice to watch for the existing reset action
4. Create a new, standalone reset action and get both slices to watch for it

## Understanding Action Flow

When an action is dispatched, it tis sent to _every_ reducer in the store.

Up to this point, we haven’t really cared about this, because the ‘combined’ reducers are configured to only care about particular action types.

## Watching for Other Actions

```jsx
// index.js

const songsSlice = createSlice({
	name: "song",
	initialState: [],
	reducers: {
		addSong(state, action) {
			// state is not the big state object in the store
			// It is the piece of state managed by this reducer
			state.push(action.payload);
		},
		removeSong(state, action) {
			// action.payload === string, the song we want to remove
			const index = state.indexOf(action.payload);
			state.splice(index, 1);
		},
	},
	extraReducers(builder) {
		builder.addCase("movie/reset", (state, action) => {
			return [];
		});
	},
});
```

## Getting an Action Creator’s Type

```jsx
	extraReducers(builder) {
		builder.addCase(moviesSlice.actions.reset, (state, action) => {
			return [];
		});
```
