# S.21 Interfacing with API’s Using Async Thunks

## Thinking About Data Structuring

```jsx
function getAlbumsForUser(user, albums) {
	return albums.filter((album) => album.userId === user.id);
}
// Function to find all the albums that belong to particular user
```

-   Denormalized Form
    -   Easier to use if the data is already structured as you need it
    -   Good if your project has rock-solid requirements that won’t change
-   Normalized Form
    -   More flexible. With a little code, we can easily figure out any relationship
    -   Downside: More code to write
