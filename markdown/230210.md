# S.11 Mastering the State Design Process

## State Design Process Overview

### Evnets + State Design Process

1. List out what a user will do and changes they will see while using your app
2. Categorize each step as ‘state’ or ‘event handler’
3. Group common steps. Remove duplicates. Rewrite descriptions
4. Look at mockup. Remove or simplify parts that aren’t changing
5. Replace remaining elements with text descriptions
6. Repeat #4 and #5 with a different variation
7. Imagine you have to write a function that returns the text of steps #5 and #6. In addition to your component props, what other argument would you need?
8. Deside where each event handler + state will be defined
