# S.3 Building with Reusable Components

## Introducing the Props System

### Props System

-   Pass data from a parent to a child
-   Allows a parent to configure each child differently (show different text, different styles, etc)
-   One way flow of data. Child canâ€™t push props back up
-   Like 25% of understanding React

### Communication with Props

-   Add attributes to a JSX element
-   React collects the attributes and puts them in an object
-   Props object shows up as the first argument to the child component function]
-   We use the props however we wish
