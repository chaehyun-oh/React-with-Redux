# S.5 Using an API with React

## Project Setup

Component design

-   App
    -   SearchBar
    -   ImageList
        -   ImageShow

## The Path Forward

< HTTP Request and Response >

Our App : Request

Unsplash API : Response

-   React has no tools, objects, functions for making HTTP requests
-   React only cares about showing content and handling user events
-   This is kind of good! We can write a lot of business logic + data fetching without worrying about React
