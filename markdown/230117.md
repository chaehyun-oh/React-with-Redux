## Events in Detail

### Using Events

-   Decide what kind of event you want to watch for
-   Create a function. Usually called an evnet handler or callback function
-   Name the function using pattern of handle + EventName
-   Pass the fucntion as a prop to a plain element
-   Make sure you pass the function using a valid event name
-   Make sure you pass a reference to the function

[SyntheticEvent - React](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html)

## Variations on Event Handlers

`console.log(doGreeting)` : Logs the ‘doGreeting’ function Does not call it.

`console.log(doGreeting())` : Immediately calls ‘doGreeting’ function and logs the return value. (it will be invoked immediately)
