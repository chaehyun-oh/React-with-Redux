# S.2 Creating Content with JSX

## Showing Basic Content

-   React : Library that defines what a component is and how multiple components work together
-   ReactDOM : Library that knows how to get a component to show up in the browser

```jsx
// 1. Import the React and ReactDOM libraries
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

//  2. Get a reference to div with ID root
const el = document.getElementById("root");

//  3. Tell React to take control of that element
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(el);

// 4. Create a component
function App() {
	return <h1>Hi there!</h1>;
}

//  5. Show the component on the screen
root.render(<App />);
```
