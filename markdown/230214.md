# S.12 Practicing Props and State Design

## The Panel Component

### Reusable “Presentation” Components

1. Create a new component that shows a handful of JSX element
2. Make sure the component accepts + uses the ‘children’ prop
3. Allow extra classNames to be passed in + merge them
4. Take extra props, pass them through to root element

## Creating the Reusable Panel

```jsx
// Panel.js

import classNames from "classnames";

function Panel({ children, className, ...rest }) {
	const finalClassNames = classNames(
		"border rounded p-3 shadow bg-white w-full",
		className
	);

	return (
		<div {...rest} className={finalClassNames}>
			{children}
		</div>
	);
}

export default Panel;
```

## Event Capture and Bubbling

: When an event occurs, browser wants to find event handlers to call.

Order in which this search occurs is divided into three phase

Capture Phase ⇒ Target Phase ⇒ Bubble Phase
